# Movie_App
This is a Movie_App based on TMDB API. where You can see the rating, description and Categories of the movies.

I use VSCode as an IDE.
Getting Started with Create index.html file.

Creating a file name index.html
Creating a file name script.js
create a file name style.css

Took The Api Key of 'TheMovieDB' by login at the website. And made a spacific change to customize the Api Key And the Api Url's.
Design the URL and sort the movies by Rating, Genre, Date etc.
By CSS I made grid's to show each movie poster and description.
